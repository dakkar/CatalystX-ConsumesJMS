=head1 NAME

CatalystX::ConsumesJMS - role for components providing Catalyst actions consuming messages

=head1 VERSION

version 1.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp::Base::Stuff;
  use Moose;
  extends 'Catalyst::Component';
  with 'CatalystX::ConsumesJMS';

  sub _kind_name {'Stuff'}
  sub _wrap_code {
    my ($self,$c,$destination_name,$msg_type,$route) = @_;
    my $code = $route->{code};
    my $extra_config = $route->{extra_config};
    return sub {
      my ($controller,$ctx) = @_;
      my $message = $ctx->req->data;
      $self->$code($message);
    }
  }

Then:

  package MyApp::Stuff::One;
  use Moose;
  extends 'MyApp::Base::Stuff';

  sub routes {
    return {
      my_input_destination => {
        my_message_type => {
          code => \&my_consume_method,
          extra_config => $whatever,
        },
        ...
      },
      ...
    }
  }

  sub my_consume_method {
    my ($self,$message) = @_;

    # do something
  }

Also, remember to tell L<Catalyst> to load your C<Stuff> components:

  <setup_components>
   search_extra [ ::Stuff ]
  </setup_components>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role is to be used to define base classes for your Catalyst-based
JMS / STOMP consumer applications. It's I<not> to be consumed directly
by application components.

=head2 Routing

Subclasses of your component base specify which messages they are
interested in, by writing a C<routes> sub, see the synopsis for an
example.

They can specify as many destinations and message types as they want /
need, and they can re-use the C<code> values as many times as needed.

The main limitation is that you can't have two components using the
exact same destination / type pair (even if they derive from different
base classes!). If you do, the results are undefined.

It is possible to alter the destination name via configuration, like:

  <Stuff::One>
   <routes_map>
    my_input_destination the_actual_destination_name
   </routes_map>
  </Stuff::One>

You can also do this:

  <Stuff::One>
   <routes_map>
    my_input_destination the_actual_destination_name
    my_input_destination another_destination_name
   </routes_map>
  </Stuff::One>

to get the consumer to consume from two different destinations without
altering the code.

=head2 The "code"

The hashref specified by each destination / type pair will be passed
to the L</_wrap_code> function (that the consuming class has to
provide), and the coderef returned will be installed as the action to
invoke when a message of that type is received from that destination.

The action, like all Catalyst actions, will be invoked passing:

=over 4

=item *

the controller instance (you should rarely need this)

=item *

the Catalyst application context

=back

You can do whatever you need in this coderef, but the synopsis gives a
generally useful idea. You can find more examples of use at
https://github.com/dakkar/CatalystX-StompSampleApps

=head1 Required methods

=head2 C<_kind_name>

As in the synopsis, this should return a string that, in the names of
the classes deriving from the consuming class, separates the
"application name" from the "component name".

These names are mostly used to access the configuration.

=head2 C<_wrap_code>

This method is called with:

=over 4

=item *

the Catalyst application as passed to C<register_actions>

=item *

the destination name

=item *

the message type

=item *

the value from the C<routes> corresponding to the destination name and
message type slot (see L</Routing> above)

=back

The coderef returned will be invoked as a Catalyst action for each
received message, which means it will get:

=over 4

=item *

the controller instance (you should rarely need this)

=item *

the Catalyst application context

=back

You can get the de-serialized message by calling C<< $c->req->data >>.
The JMS headers will most probably be in C<< $c->req->env >> (or C<<
$c->engine->env >> for older Catalyst), all keys namespaced by
prefixing them with C<jms.>. So to get all JMS headers you could do:

   my $psgi_env = $c->req->can('env')
                  ? $c->req->env
                  : $c->engine->env;
   my %headers = map { s/^jms\.//r, $psgi_env->{$_} }
                 grep { /^jms\./ } keys $psgi_env;

You can set the message to serialise in the response by setting C<<
$c->stash->{message} >>, and the headers by calling C<<
$c->res->header >> (yes, incoming and outgoing data are handled
asymmetrically. Sorry.)

=head1 Implementation Details

B<HERE BE DRAGONS>.

This role should be consumed by sub-classes of C<Catalyst::Component>.

The consuming class is supposed to be used as a base class for
application components (see the L</SYNOPSIS>, and make sure to tell
Catalyst to load them!).

Since these components won't be in the normal Model/View/Controller
namespaces, we need to modify the C<COMPONENT> method to pick up the
correct configuration options. This is were L</_kind_name> is used.

We hijack the C<expand_modules> method to generate various bits of
Catalyst code on the fly.

If the component has a configuration entry C<enabled> with a false
value, it is ignored, thus disabling it completely.

We generate a controller package for each destination, by calling
L</_generate_controller_package>, and we add an C<after> method
modifier to its C<register_actions> method inherited from
C<Catalyst::Controller>, to create the actions for each message
type. The modifier is generated by calling
L</_generate_register_action_modifier>.

=head2 C<_generate_controller_package>

  my $pkg = $self->_generate_controller_package(
                $appname,$destination,
                $config,$route);

Generates a controller package, inheriting from whatever
L</_controller_base_classes> returns, called
C<${appname}::Controller::${destination_name}>. Any roles returned by
L</_controller_roles> are applied to the controller.

Inside the controller, we set the C<namespace> config slot to the
destination name.

=head2 C<_controller_base_classes>

List (not arrayref!) of class names that the controllers generated by
L</_generate_controller_package> should inherit from. Defaults to
C<'Catalyst::Controller::JMS'>.

=head2 C<_controller_roles>

List (not arrayref!) of role names that should be applied to the
controllers created by L</_generate_controller_package>. Defaults to
the empty list.

=head2 C<_generate_register_action_modifier>

  my $modifier = $self->_generate_register_action_modifier(
                   $appname,$destination,
                   $controller_pkg,
                   $config,$route);

Returns a coderef to be installed as an C<after> method modifier to
the C<register_actions> method. The coderef will register each action
with the Catalyst dispatcher. Each action will have the attribute
C<MessageTarget>, see L<Catalyst::Controller::JMS>.

Each action's code is obtained by calling L</_wrap_code>.
